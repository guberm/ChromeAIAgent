# Release Notes for v2.2.5

## ðŸš€ What's New in 2.2.5

- **Capture & Summarize Feature:**
  - New "Capture & Summarize" button in the side panel lets you take a screenshot of the visible tab and get an instant AI-generated summary.

  - Summary includes page title, key highlights, warnings/errors, and next recommended actions.
- **Reliability Improvements:**
  - All changes are mirrored to the build folder for runtime consistency.
  - Minor UI and automation robustness fixes.
