# Icon Placeholders

The icons directory should contain the following PNG files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)

These are placeholder files. Replace with actual icon images for the extension.

To create icons:
1. Design a 128x128 pixel icon representing an AI/robot theme
2. Create smaller versions (48x48, 32x32, 16x16) for different UI contexts
3. Use PNG format with transparency support
4. Ensure the icon is recognizable at all sizes

Recommended colors:
- Primary: #1a73e8 (Google Blue)
- Secondary: #34a853 (Google Green)  
- Accent: #ea4335 (Google Red)

Icon should include:
- Robot or AI-related symbolism
